<blockquote>
I keep on receiving EncryptionOperationNotPossibleException exceptions when trying to decrypt my data.

EncryptionOperationNotPossibleException is a very general exception which jasypt raises whenever there is a problem with encryption or decryption operations. It does not provide any further information to prevent the encryption infrastructure from showing too much information about what is going on (we wouldn't want an attacker to get any algorithm-specific errors...)

When you get that error while decrypting, most of the times it will simply mean that the encrypted string you input was not adequate for the algorithm/password/keyObtentionIterations configuration you provided. Check that your encryptor is configured in exactly the same way as the one with which you originally encrypted the data.

Also, if you are storing your encrypted data into a database, check that the table columns that you use to store it are big enough to host the encrypted data (which is always bigger than the original data). If you are transmitting your encrypted data via HTTP, check that you are not having problems with the transmission of BASE64-encoded data as URL parameters (BASE64 uses characters which are forbidden in URL parameters, like "="). For these uses, try using hexadecimal output.
